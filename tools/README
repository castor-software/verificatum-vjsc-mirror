This library contains a number of scripts that we wrote because
JavaScript is a bad language and we refuse to write code specific to a
given platform or framework.

Thus, although these scripts can only be categorized as hacks, they
rely only on old and well known commands and the end result is a pure
JavaScript file that uses proper encapsulation and is properly
indented.

This is a deliberate tradeoff that we have chosen to make. Feel free
to suggest better methods, but please think through all the aspect of
your solution.
